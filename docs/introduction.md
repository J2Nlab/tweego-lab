This documentation is a reference for [Tweego](http://www.motoslave.net/tweego/), a free (gratis and libre) [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) compiler for [Twine](http://twinery.org/) projects, written in [Go](http://golang.org/).

Why use Tweego?  Tweego lets you write Twine projects using your favorite text editor, rather than the [Twine software](http://twinery.org/).  You write passages in plain text files using the [Twee notation](#twee-notation) across as few or as many files as you choose, which can make working, and collaborating, on Twine projects faster and easier.  When you're ready to publish or test, you simply compile all your project files into an `.html` file with Tweego.
